            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been widely adopted
                in both high-performance servers and embedded systems. Since
                static random access memory (SRAM) has limited density and
                comparatively high leakage power, researchers have proposed
                FPGA architectures based on emerging non-volatile memories
                (NVMs) to satisfy the requirements of data-intensive and low-power applications.
                Block RAM is on-chip memory of FPGAs,
                when it is implemented with NVM, it will face the challenge of
                limited endurance. Traditional wear leveling strategy cannot be
                directly applied to block RAM because it may induce large performance overhead. In this paper, we
                propose a performance-aware
                wear leveling scheme for block RAM in FPGAs to improve its
                lifetime. The placement strategy is improved by injecting wear
                leveling guidance. The evaluation shows that 29.75% lifetime enhancement is achieved with 16.32%
                performance improvement
                at the same time, compared with traditional wear leveling.</p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            Nowadays, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become popular in many areas including embedded
            systems, massively parallel computing, etc. On-chip block random access memory (BRAM) is an important
            component in FPGAs, used for parameter and data storage. Currently, in the FPGA platforms, the
            on-chip RAM is based on static random access memory (SRAM),
            which has high leakage power and low memory density. As the
            development of applications related to deep learning and big data
            processing, the requirement on the capacity of on-chip block
            RAM is continuously increasing. With the development of
            process technology, the total BRAM capacity increases, but the static power of FPGA
            platforms has exceeded
            dynamic power. Therefore, SRAM has become the obstacle
            of building high-capacity low-power FPGAs.<br><br>
            To solve these problems, researchers propose to replace the
            SRAM cell in FPGAs with non-volatile memory (NVM). Compared to SRAM, NVM has some advantages such as higher
            density, lower static power consumption and non-volatility, which
            bring FPGAs an opportunity to have more memory cells to break
            through the bottleneck of insufficient capacity. A variety of FPGA
            architectures are explored based on different NVMs, e.g., phase
            change memory (PCM) based FPGA, spin-transfer torque
            magnetic memory (STT-RAM) based FPGA, resistive random
            access memory (RRAM) based FPGA and so on. Meanwhile, the gap between SRAM-based and STT-RAM-based BRAM
            operating frequencies gets smaller with increasing BRAM
            size.
            This is due to the fact that STT-RAM-based BRAM operating
            frequency is dominated by cell switching time which is constant
            regardless of BRAM size. <br><br>
            Even though nonvolatile FPGAs enjoy the large on-chip RAM
            capacity and near-zero leakage power, they face challenges of
            large program overhead and limited lifetime. For example, the
            write endurance of RRAM is about 10<sup>12</sup>, while PCM is only 10<sup>9</sup>
            . There are researches working on write reduction to NVM in
            conventional memory systems, which can effectively reduce the
            program cost, and simultaneously improve the lifetime to some
            extent. Meanwhile, for NVM-based FPGAs platform, some
            researches have proposed strategies to reduce or balance the
            writing to configurable logic blocks (CLBs), connecting blocks
            (CBs) and switch boxes (SBs). These works have made
            good achievements, but compared to CLBs, CBs and SBs, BRAM
            blocks are more likely to be worn out. Thus, we are considering
            the lifetime improvement of BRAM blocks in this paper.<br><br>
            Wear leveling (WL) is a group of work aiming to enhance
            NVM lifetime, where the basic idea is to balance the writes across
            various physical regions of NVM so that the lifetime is not limited to few early-worn portions. The
            general idea is to dynamically swap the mapped address between highly written and
            rarely written regions. However, the WL techniques proposed
            in memory fields cannot directly be applied to BRAM in FPGAs.
            This is because that the data placement among different BRAM
            blocks highly affects the system performance in FPGAs and data
            swapping aiming to lifetime optimization may induce high performance overhead. In order to achieve a balance
            between performance and lifetime, we propose a performance-aware WL
            mechanism. Specifically, the main contributions of this paper are
            as follows:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><p> Propose to simultaneously consider lifetime and performance in WL for BRAM blocks in FPGA
                    systems.</p></li>
                <li><p>Design a performance-aware WL mechanism to balance
                    write traffic between BRAM blocks. The placement strategy is improved by integrating write
                    information so
                    that
                    multiple configuration files can be generated for dynamic
                    switching.</p></li>
                <li><p>Develop a simulator to evaluate performance and lifetime
                    for non-volatile FPGAs. The evaluation results show significant lifetime improvement with little
                    performance
                    overhead.</p></li>
